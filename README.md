# Business-Operations-Database-System
This project showcases the design and implementation of a database system for business operations using SQL. It includes scripts for creating tables, managing views, inserting data, and handling transactions. Detailed annotations and a presentation provide clear insights into the database structure and functionality.

---

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates comprehensive database operations and management using SQL. It covers key database functionalities such as creating tables, views, inserting data, and handling business transactions. The project also includes detailed documentation and a presentation for better understanding.

---

## Key Features
- **SQL Scripts**: Extensive SQL operations including table creation, view management, and data manipulation.
- **Documentation**: Annotated explanations of all SQL commands used.
- **Business Logic**: Transactions and query optimizations for efficient database handling.
- **Presentation**: Visual representation of project objectives and outcomes.

---

## Data
- **Tables**: Structured to represent business transactions and operations.
- **Views**: Designed for optimized data retrieval.
- **Statements**:
  - `Create Table` and `Drop Table`
  - `Create View` and `Drop View`
  - `Insert Into` and `Select` operations

---

## Methodology
1. **Database Design**:
   - Structured tables and views to align with business logic.
2. **SQL Implementation**:
   - Step-by-step execution of SQL scripts.
3. **Annotations**:
   - Detailed insights and comments for each SQL operation.

---

## Key Findings
- Clear understanding of database schema design and SQL functionalities.
- Efficient data manipulation through optimized queries.
- Seamless integration of business logic into database operations.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: SQL
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench or any compatible SQL client
- **Presentation**: Microsoft PowerPoint

---

## Setup and Installation
1. Install a SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench).
2. Import and execute the SQL scripts in the following order:
   - `Create Table` statements
   - `Insert Into` statements
   - `Create View` statements
3. Test the database functionality with provided `Select` and transaction scripts.

---

## Usage
1. Run the `Create Table` script to initialize the database schema.
2. Populate the database with the `Insert Into` script.
3. Execute queries using the `Select` statements for analysis.
4. Use the `Drop Table` and `Drop View` scripts for cleanup.
